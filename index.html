            <h3 id="headline">Introduction</h3>
            <p>In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of features of a software system.
                They are written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system, and may be recorded on index cards,
                Post-it notes, or digitally in project management software. Depending on the project, user stories may be written by different stakeholders like client,
                user, manager, or development team. User stories are a type of boundary object.
                They facilitate sensemaking and communication; and may help software teams document their understanding of the system and its context.
            </p>
            <h3>History</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1998</strong> - Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3 project in Detroit and coined the phrase "A user story is a promise for a conversation."</li>
                <li><strong>1999</strong> - Kent Beck published the first edition of the book Extreme Programming Explained, introducing Extreme Programming (XP), and the usage of user stories in the planning game.</li>
                <li><strong>2001</strong>- Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story creation:</li>
                <ul>
                        <li>The Card (or often a post-it note) is a tangible physical token to hold the concepts;</li>
                        <li>The Conversation is between the stakeholders (customers, users, developers, testers, etc.). It is verbal and often supplemented by documentation;</li>
                        <li>The Confirmation ensures that the objectives of the conversation have been reached.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>2001</strong>- The XP team at Connextra in London devised the user story format and shared examples with others.</li>
                <li><strong>2004</strong>- Mike Cohn generalized the principles of user stories beyond the usage of cards in his book User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development that is now considered the standard reference for the topic according to Martin Fowler. Cohn names Rachel Davies as the inventor of user stories. While Davies was a team member at Connextra she credits the team as a whole with the invention.</li>
                <li><strong>2014</strong>- After a first article in 2005 and a blog post in 2008, in 2014 Jeff Patton published the user-story mapping technique, which intends to improve with a systematic approach the identification of user stories and to structure the stories to give better visibility to their interdependence.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Principle</h3>
            <p>
                User stories are written by or for users or customers to influence the functionality of the system being developed. In some teams, the product manager (or product owner in Scrum), is primarily responsible for formulating user stories and organizing them into a product backlog. In other teams, anyone can write a user story. User stories can be developed through discussion with stakeholders, based on personas or simply made up.
            </p>
            <h4>Common templates</h4>
            <p>
                User stories may follow one of several formats or templates. <br>
                The most common is the Connextra template, stated below. Mike Cohn suggested the "so that" clause is optional although still often helpful.<br>

            <pre><code> As a &lt;role&gt; I can &lt;capability&gt;, so that &lt;receive benefit&gt; </code></pre><br>
                Chris Matts suggested that "hunting the value" was the first step in successfully delivering software, and proposed this alternative:<br>

            <pre><code>In order to &lt;receive benefit&gt; as a &lt;role&gt;, I can &lt;goal/desire&gt;</code></pre><br>
                Another template based on the Five Ws specifies: <br>
            <pre><code>As &lt;who&gt; &lt;when&gt; &lt;where&gt;, I want &lt;what&gt; because &lt;why&gt;</code></pre><br>
            </p>

            <h3>Examples</h3>
            <p>
                <h4>Screening Quiz (Epic Story)</h4>
                <p>
                    As the HR manager, I want to create a screening quiz so that I can understand whether I want to send possible recruits to the functional manager.
                </p>
                <h4>Quiz Recall</h4>
                <p>
                    As a manager, I want to browse my existing quizzes so I can recall what I have in place and figure out if I can just reuse or update an existing quiz for the position I need now.
                </p>
                <h4>Limited Backup</h4>
                <p>
                    As a user, I can indicate folders not to back up so that my backup drive isn't filled up with things I don't need saved.
